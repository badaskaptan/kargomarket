# KargoMarket AI Agent Quick Navigation Guide

## üéØ Purpose

This is a quick reference guide for AI agents and developers working on the KargoMarket project. For complete documentation, see the master documentation index.

## üìã Quick Links

- **Main Documentation**: `docs/MASTER_DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md`
- **Technical Implementation**: `docs/database/TECHNICAL_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md`  
- **Deployment Guide**: `docs/deployment/SERVICE_OFFER_DEPLOYMENT_COMPLETE.md`
- **Complete Agent Guide**: `docs/guides/AI_AGENT_COMPLETE_GUIDE.md`

## üö® Critical Information

### System Status
- ‚úÖ Service offer system: 100% complete and deployed

## üìä Recent Lessons Learned

### ListingsPage Email Visibility Issue (August 2025)

**Context:**
- Email field was not visible on listing cards for logged-in users, despite correct backend/frontend logic.
- Adding a `console.log` in the render function caused the email to appear; removing it did not revert the fix.

**Key Takeaways:**
- React state/rendering issues can cause UI to not update as expected, even if the data and logic are correct.
- Adding/removing debug code (like `console.log`) can trigger a re-render and "fix" the UI, masking the real issue.
- Always hard refresh and clear cache when debugging UI data flow issues.
- Confirm that all state and props are up-to-date and not stale.
- Avoid leaving debug code in production; use it only for troubleshooting.

**Best Practices:**
- When UI does not reflect expected data, check for stale state, memoization, or missed re-renders.
- Use React DevTools to inspect component state and props.
- After debugging, always remove temporary code and verify the issue does not return.

**Actionable Note:**
- If a UI bug "fixes itself" after a code change unrelated to logic, suspect a render/state/cache issue first.

## üîÑ Maintenance Protocol

This guide MUST be updated whenever:
- Major implementation changes occur
- New workflows or patterns are introduced  
- Database schema modifications are made
- Project structure is reorganized

### Review Schedule
- Check master documentation before starting any task
- Review status reports for latest updates
- Update this guide when making significant changes
- Maintain consistency with other documentation files

## üìù Next Steps for AI Agents

1. **Check master documentation**: Always start with `docs/MASTER_DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md`
2. **Review current status**: Check the deployment complete guide for latest updates
3. **Understand project structure**: All documentation is now organized in docs/ and sql/ folders  
4. **Follow implementation guides**: Use technical implementation guide for code changes
5. **Update documentation**: Keep all guides synchronized when making changes

## üéØ Quick Commands

```bash
# Start development
npm run dev

# Build project  
npm run build

# Check git status
git status

# View organized structure
ls docs/
ls sql/
```
